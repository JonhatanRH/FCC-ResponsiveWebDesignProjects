                <li><b>1941</b> - He completed his preliminary studies from Los Angeles High School and later enrolled at Los Angeles City College to study art, journalism, and literature. He quit college after two years and instead pursued a blue-collared job in New York.</li>

                <li><b>1944</b> - His tryst with writing started soon after he left college; his first ever publication being a short story titled ‘Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection’.</li>
                <li><b>1946</b> - His second short story, ‘20 Tanks from Kasseldown’ was published by Black Sun Press. Not finding much success with his printed works, he decided to give up on his literary aspirations.</li>

                <li><b>1959</b>-He came up with his inaugural book of poetry, ‘Flower, Fist and Bestial Wail’.

                <li><b>1960</b>-He resumed his duties as the letter filling clerk at the post office in Los Angeles, a position which he held for almost a decade. During this period, he penned much of the pains and agony of his early life into a series of poems and short stories.</li>
                <li><b>1963</b>-He came up with a poetry collection, ‘It Catches my Heart in Its Hands’. Written in the period between 1955 and 1963, each of the poem in the book was unrivalled in terms of content and beautifully merged together.</li>
                <li><b>1969</b>- He accepted the offer by Black Sparrow Press of becoming a full-time writer, which led him to quit his post office job for good. Just a month later, he finished his semi-autobiographical first novel, ‘Post Office’.</li>

                <li><b>1980s </b>- Bukowski venture forth into the genre of screenplay writing for the film ‘Barfly’, released in 1984. Semi-autobiographical, the film revolved around three days in the life of Bukowski’s when he was 24. Like his other works, the film had his alter-ego character of Henry Chinaski play the protagonist. It was his experience with making ‘Barfly’ that formed the basis of his next novel, ‘Hollywood’.</li>
                <li>Shortly before his death, he completed his last novel, ‘Pulp’. Much like his last poetry collection published in his lifetime, ‘The Last Night of the Earth Poems’, ‘Pulp’ dealt with the theme of mortality wrapped in scathing humor.</li>
